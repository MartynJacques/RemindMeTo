remindmeto is a simple bash script which uses Applescript to create a reminder
from the terminal application.

Allow the program to be executed by using chmod 755 remindmeto.

Run the program using ./terminal 'title_of_reminder' where title_of_reminder is
the name of the reminder you want to create e.g.:

./remindmeto 'Get eggs from the shop'
